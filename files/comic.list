http://xkcd.com	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/1337_part_3.png	I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA. And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.

http://xkcd.com	http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/swine_flu.png	Bad flu epidemics can hit young adults hardest because they provoke their powerful immune systems into overreaction, so to stay healthy spend the next few weeks drunk and sleep-deprived to keep yours suppressed.
