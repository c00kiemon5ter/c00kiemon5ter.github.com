c00kiemon5ter's masterplan
==========================
{there is none}

Wat
---
This is my personal blog about thoughts, troublings, technology, coding, life, photography, politics, economy, trolling, 
girls, music and cookies. Most importantly, this is about cookies and their takeabouts to total world domination. 

How
---
Based on the mighty [jekyll][jekyll]. [Toto][toto] was a nice 
candidate but, it seems jekyll works best with [github pages][ghpages]. 
Another interesting alternative I may consider in the future is [fugitive][fugitive].

The whole site is static. Comments are handled through [disqus][disqus] and are enabled on demand. 
Fonts are embedded through [typekit][typekit]. Feed is handled by [feedburner][feed].
Posts are written in [markdown][mkdn].

Who
---
Design was inspired by [mojombo][tpw] and [travis][travis] and freshly baked cookies.

Why
---
cause cookies shall prevail! (plus this world needs some more bloat)
