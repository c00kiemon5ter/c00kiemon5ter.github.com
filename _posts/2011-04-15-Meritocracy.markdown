================
[Meritocracy] is a system wherein appointments are made and responsibilities assigned 
to individuals based upon their "merits", namely intelligence, credentials, and education, 
determined through evaluations or examinations.

> Facts and Figures

In other words, in a Meritocracy based system, one is assigned a job by presenting facts. 
The job one is assigned is justified by his abilities and quality of his previous work. 
For one to reach a highly important position, he has to work his way up there, 
proving he is capable of completing the task he's been given.

Consequently power is given to those that proved themselves worthy of it. This group of people
should be intelligent enough and willing to lead by the way the whole benefits.

Democracy
---------
[Democracy] is the kind of system that allows *citizens* the right to have a say in the
decisions that affect their lives. Ideally, this includes equal participation in the proposal,
development and passage of legislation into law. 

Two of Democracy's most important characteristics are *equality* and *freedom*.
This means every citizen has the right to speak their mind freely and influence
every decision under question. 

> Power is held by the citizens

Right. This sounds good and all, but, take a minute and look around..

People are dumb 
---------------
We live and age in a world where what matters is matter. We strive to educate ourselves so that we
make a successful career and live with as much as we can have. We are surrounded by an oppression
of consumption. We look and form ourselves by how we'll be more accepted by others, how we'll more 
easily fit in. We idolize movie celebrities, blindly follow massification models like fashion and 
religion and claim wars in the name of "the good". What happened [ethos] ?

> The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life

I don't necessarily blame just people. People are easily manipulated. What crafts one's behavior, 
what one thinks is rational and logical, choices and actions, are deeply influenced by the way one
is brought up, their environment, friends, people they've met and communicated with, education and 
openness to curiosity. 

People have forgotten of ideals or ethics. There is nothing to believe in, nothing to fight for.
Most people do what they're told, imitating others, fitting in. There is no questioning, no 
productive criticism, no rational thinking or judging. 
They learn to work and work hard with nothing as close to equal in return. Money has become the 
purpose of any choice and action. 
Sadly people can't recognize happiness or appreciate the [small pleasures][happiness] in life.

Open Source Software
--------------------
The group of people I consider highly rational and logical in making choices is coders.
Building software, especially open source software where huge collaboration takes place,
is a process that makes you sit down and actually think. Every choice is important.
Every architecture and design a coder hacks is carefully thought so that it benefits himself,
other coders that want to hack into his project, other coders that want to extend his software,
designers that set to create a usable interface, users that want to get results, companies
that want results fast etc. 

Coders make choices based on [utilitarianism]. Coders are trained to think in a way that 
[utility functions][utility] pop up in their minds subconsciously. They compute which choice
maximizes utility and usefulness, and minimize cost on the fly. 

> [Open Source is not a Democracy. It's a Meritocracy][oosmeritocracy]

Almost all open source projects are managed in such a way that they resemble Meritocracy.
Core members are not elected by the community. Rather, they are appointed to their position 
based on their qualifications, and are tasked with governing in such a manner that will yield 
the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

There are no political parties, campaigns or lies and promises. Instead, a person is judged 
entirely by the code that they write, and the relative usefulness of the later to the community 
at large. No one is "elected" into an open source team. You get invited, usually (and hopefully) 
on the basis of your individual merit and perceived dedication to the project.

But the most important thing with coders, is that they do all that purely for the fun of it. 
They create stuff and that makes them feel nice. They dedicate themselves in their project and ask
as much as to keep them living happily (drinking beer) and continuing their work on their project.

Bugs
----
As with every software, everything in existence has bugs and flaws or hidden caveats. 
Plato's discussions on [regimes] presents what each of the 5 regimes he examines - 
Aristocracy, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy and Tyranny - really stands for, and how 
each one can be abused.

Meritocracy itself hides some really serious flaws. These lie between the lines of what actually 
a *merit* is. Merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical talent 
or even work ethic, beliefs and ideals. How it is a merit defined, where does that definition fit, 
how is it justified and who has the wisdom to say what of it is correct or not. 
A "merit" is practically a highly subjective term.
Then comes *metric*. How does one effectively measure merit ? How does one prove he's "more educated" 
than another ? Who can set exams and say they prove the right thing ? Remember merit is more than raw
knowledge on a particular subject.

Another problem is how equality is handled. There are many types of [equality], we'll be talking
about [Equality of Opportunity][eqopp], in the sense of giving everyone the same starting point and

--> Opportunity equality  
--> Solutions ?
Representative Democracy | Greece | No money for politics

Until philosophers rule as kings or 
those who are now called kings and leading men genuinely and adequately philosophise, 
that is, until political power and philosophy entirely coincide, 
while the many natures who at present pursue either one exclusively 
are forcibly prevented from doing so, 
cities will have no rest from evils, 
..nor, I think, will the human race -- {{ page.date | date_to_string }}
