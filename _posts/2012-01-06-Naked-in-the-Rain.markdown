Vodka Juniors ~ Dark Poetry
===========================

When everything's going wrong,
everything around you seems like a movie you can't relate to,
you feel tired of everything
and you're at the bottom of the shit
and everyone keeps pushing you,
there comes a moment of clarity in your mind,
that you pick up the guitar
and write a song about it.
Then it feels a bit better.
Then you put out the record
and people get the songs
and then comes a time you're playing live
and as you scream the words of that song
there is a boy or a girl right in front of you
that screams the same words as if it was his song.
And then you realise you're not alone...
Nothing can ever beat that feeling...
