================

Nihilism confuses people. "How can you care about anything, or strive for
anything, if you believe nothing means anything?" they ask.

In return, nihilists point to the assumption of inherent meaning and question
that assumption. Do we need existence to mean anything? After all, existence
stays out there no matter what we think of it. We can do with it what we will.
Some of us will desire more beauty, more efficiency, more function or more truth
-- and others will not. Conflict results.

Nihilists who aren't of the kiddie anarchist variety tend to draw a distinction
between nihilism and fatalism. Nihilism says that nothing has meaning. Fatalists
say that nothing has meaning, so nothing will have meaning for them personally.
It's the difference between having no authority figure to tell you what's right,
and giving up on the idea of doing anything since no one will affirm that what
you've done is right.


What is nihilism?
-----------------

As a nihilist, I recognize that meaning does not exist. If we exterminate
ourselves as a species, and vaporize our beautiful world, the universe will not
cry with us (a condition called the pathetic fallacy). No gods will intervene.
It will just happen and then -- and then the universe will go on. We will not be
remembered. We will simply not be.

In the same way, I accept that when I die, the most likely outcome will be a
cessation of being. I will at that moment cease to be the source of my thoughts
and feelings. Those feelings having only existed inside of me, never did "exist"
except as electro-chemical impulses, and will no longer be found when I am gone.

Even further, I recognize that there is no golden standard for life. If I note
that living in a polluted wasteland is stupid and pointless, others may not see
this. They may kill me when I mention it. And then they will go on, and I will
not. Insensitive to their polluted wasteworld, they will keep living in it and
suffering under it, oblivious to the existence of an option.

A tree falling in a forest unobserved makes a sound. The forest may not
recognize this as a sound because a forest is many life forms interacting, not
organized by some central principle or consciousness. They just do what they do.
In the same way, playing Beethoven's Ninth to a bowl of yeast will not elicit a
response. The insensate remain unobservant, much like the universe itself.

Many people "feel" marginalized when they think of this. Where is the Great
Father who will hear their thoughts, validate their emotions, and tell them with
certainty what is true and what is not? Where is the writing on the wall, the
final proof, the word of God? How do we know for certain that anything is true,
and if it is true, that it's important?

Meaning is the human attempt to mold the world in our own image. We need some
meaning to our existence, but feel doubt when we try to proclaim it as a
creation of ourselves. So we look for some external meaning that we can show
others and have them agree that it exists. This forces us to start judging every
idea we encounter as threatening or affirming of our projected external meaning.

This distanced mentality further affirms our tendency to find the world
alienating to our consciousness. In our minds, cause and effect are the same; we
use our will to formulate an idea and it is there, in symbolic form. When we
take that idea to the world and try to implement it, however, we can estimate
how the world will react but we are frequently wrong, and this causes us doubt.

As a result, we like to separate the world from our minds and live in a world
created by our minds. In this humanist view, every human is important. Every
human emotion is sacred. Every human preference needs to be respected. It is us
against the world, trying to assert our projected reality where we can because
we fear the lack of human-ness in the world at large.

Nihilism reverses this process. It replaces externalized meaning with two
important viewpoints. The first is pragmatism; what matters are the consequences
in physical reality, and if there is a spiritual realm, it must operate in
parallel with physical reality. The second is preferentialism; instead of trying
to "prove" meaning, we pick what appeals to us -- and acknowledge that who we
are biologically determines what we seek.

In rejecting anthropomorphic pathetic fallacies such as inherent "meaning,"
nihilism allows us to toss out anthropomorphism. The idea of an absolute
morality, or any value to human life, is discarded. What matters are
consequences. Consequences are not measured by their impact on humans, but by
their impact on reality as a whole. If a tree falls in a forest, it makes a
sound; if I exterminate a species and no human sees it, it happened anyway.

Your dictionary will tell you that nihilism is "a doctrine that denies any
objective ground of truth and especially of moral truths." It's not a doctrine;
it's a method, like the scientific method, which starts by crawling out of the
ghetto of our own minds. It is a quieting of the parts of our minds that want to
insist that our human perspective is the only real one, and the universe must
adapt to us, instead of the sane alternative of adapting to our universe.

In this view, nihilism is a gateway and an underpinning to philosophy, not a
philosophy in itself. It is an end to anthropomorphism, narcissism and
solipsism. It is humans finally fully evolving and getting control of their own
minds. As such, it is a starting point from which we can return to philosophy
and re-analyze it all, knowing that our perspective is closer to that of the
reality outside our minds.


Spiritual Nihilism
------------------

Although many interpret nihilism to negate spirituality, the only coherent
statement of nihilism is that there is a lack of inherent meaning. This does not
preclude spirituality, only a sense of calling it inherent. This means that
nihilist spirituality is exclusively transcendentalist, meaning that by
observing the world and finding beauty in it, we discover a spirituality
emerging from it; we don't require a separate spiritual authority or lack
thereof.

It is incorrect to say that nihilism is atheistic or agnostic. Atheism is
incoherent: claiming an inherent meaning to the negation of God is a false
objectivity just like claiming we can prove there is a God. Agnosticism makes
spirituality revolve around the concept of uncertainty over the idea of God.
Secular humanism replaces God with an idealized individual. These are all
pointless to a nihilist.

In the nihilist view, any divine beings would exist like the wind -- a force of
nature, without moral balance, without any inherent meaning to its existence. A
nihilist could note the existence of a god, and then shrug and move on. Many
things exist, after all. What is more important to a nihilist is not inherent
meaning, but the design, patterns and interconnected elements of the universe.
By observing these, we find a way to discover meaning through our
interpretation.

This in turn enables us to make unforced moral choices. If we are relying on
another world to reward us where we don't get rewarded here, we are not making a
sacrifice. If we believe that a God outside of the world must exist in order for
it to be good, we are slandering the world. Even if we think there is an
inherent right way of doing things, and that we may get rewarded for it, we are
not making moral choices.

Moral choices occur when we realize there is no compelling force on us to make
that decision except our inclination to care about the consequences. That in
turn is contingent upon us being hardwired with enough intelligence to revere
nature, the cosmos and all that has brought us consciousness. Indeed, the only
way we will have such respect for the world is if we view consciousness and life
as a gift, and therefore choose to enhance and complement the order of nature.

In a nihilist worldview, whether we live or die as a species has no inherent
value. We could stay, or blow away like a dead leaf, and the universe doesn't
care a bit. Here we must separate judgment, or caring about consequences, from
the consequences themselves. If I fire a gun at someone and he dies, the
consequence is his death. If I have no judgment of it, that means nothing more
than his permanent absence.

If the universe has the same absence of judgment, there is nothing more than his
absence. No cosmic conclusions, no judging by gods (even if we choose to believe
they exist), and no emotion shared by everyone. It is the event and nothing
more, like a tree falling in a forest when no one is around to hear its crash.

Since there are no inherent judgments in our universe, and no absolute and
objective sense of judgment, what matters is our preference regarding
consequences. We may choose not to survive as a species, in which case insanity
and sanity have the same value level, since survival no longer has a position of
value for us. Our survival is not inherently judged to be good; it's up to us to
do that.

In nihilism, as in every sufficiently advanced philosophy, the ultimate goal
is to make "everything just what it is," or to decipher enough of our
consciousness that we do not confuse the instrument (our minds) with its
object (our world). To a nihilist, the greatest human problem is solipsism,
or a confusion of the mind with the world; our solution is to point out that
the human values we consider "objective" and "inherent" are only pretense.

Nihilism conditions us instead to actualize ourselves. It denies nothing of
the lack of inherent meaning to existence, and does not create a false
"objective" reality based on our perceptions of what we wish did exist.
Instead, it charges us to choose what we wish existed, and to work toward
making it occur in reality.

The fully actualized human is able to say: I studied how the world works; I
know how to predict its responses with resonable success; I know what cause
will create what effect. As a result, we can say, I am going to pick a
certain effect I desire that is coherent with the organization of our world,
so it will succeed.

This returns us to the question of whether beauty is discovered, or
invented; some suggest that beauty is inherent to certain approaches to
organization of form, while others think we can invent it of our own accord.
A nihilist would say that the patterns that define beauty are not arbitrary,
therefore have a precedent in the extra-human cosmos, and that our artists
create beauty by perceiving the organization of our world and then
transposing it to a new, human form.

Through the embrace of "ultimate reality" -- or physical reality and the
abstractions that directly describe its organization, in contrast to
opinions and judgments -- as the only inherent constant to life, nihilism
forces humans to make the ultimate moral decision. In a world that requires
both good and bad for survival, do we choose to strive for what's good, even
knowing that it may require us to use bad methods and face bad consequences?

The ultimate test of spirituality in nature is not whether we can proclaim
universal love for all human beings, or declare ourselves pacifists. It is
whether we can do what is necessary for survival and improvement of
ourselves, as this is the only way to approach our world with a truly
reverent attitude: to adopt its methods, and through an unforced moral
preference, choose to rise and not descend.

We must make the leap of faith and choose to believe not in the existence of
the divine, but in its possibility through the merging of our imagination
with our knowledge of reality. Finding divinity in the venal and material
world requires an epic transcendental viewpoint that finds in the working of
an order a holiness, because that order provides the grounding that grants
us our own consciousness. If we love life, we find it to be holy and become
reverent to it, and thus as nihilists can rapidly discover transcendental
mysticism and transcendental idealism.

From this viewpoint, it's easy to see how nihilism can be compatible with
any faith, including Christianity. As long as we do not confuse our
interpretation of reality ("God") with reality itself, we are
transcendentalists who find our source of spiritualism in the organization
of the physical world around us and our mental state, which we can see as
having parallel and similar function. When people talk about God, a nihilist
thinks of the patterns of trees.


Practical Nihilism
------------------

How does a nihilist, or one who is beyond morality and the sanctity of human
life and illusions, apply these principles in everyday life? The short answer is
"very carefully." Human history provides one story after another of how a few
smart people started something good, then parasites encrusted it, and eventually
formed a political movement to murder those who knew better, thus plunging that
something good into disrepair.

The essence of nihilism is transcendence through eliminating a false "inherent"
meaning that is a projection of our minds. When we have cleared away the
illusion, and can look at reality as a continuum of cause and effect
relationships, we can know how to adapt to that reality. This gets us over the
fear of reality that causes us to retreat into our own minds, a condition known
as solipsism.

This in turn leads to a kind of primal realism that rejects everything but the
methods of nature. These are inherent to not only biology, but physics and the
patterns of our own thoughts. We need no inherent meaning; we need only to adapt
to our world and, from the palette of options offered, choose what we desire. Do
we want to live in mud huts, or like the ancient Greeks and Romans strive for a
society of advanced learning?

Most people confuse fatalism with nihilism. Fatalism, or the idea that things
are as they are and will not change, relies on an inherent "meaning" being
denied for its emotional power. Fatalism is a shrug and a wish that things could
be different, but since they are not, we will ignore them. Nihilism is the
opposite principle: a reverent acceptance of nature as functional and in fact
genius, and a determination to master it.

This is not a philosophy for the weak of heart, mind or body. It demands that we
look clear-eyed at truths that most find upsetting, and then force ourselves
past them as a means of disciplining ourselves toward self-actualization. Much
as nihilism removes false inherent meaning, self-actualization removes the drama
of the externalized self and replaces it with a sense of purpose: what quest
makes meaning out of my life?

Unlike Christianity and Buddhism which seek to destroy the ego, nihilism seeks
to remove the groundwork that makes the ego seem like all we have. It negates
both materialism, or living for physical comfort, and dualism, or living for a
moral god in another world that does not parallel our own in function. Any
spiritual realm will parallel this one, because since matter, energy and
thoughts show parallel mechanisms in their patterning, any other force would do
the same.

Further, ego-negation is a false form of inherent meaning. A meaning defined in
negative terms flatters the object as much as its positive counterpart; to say
I'm anti-vole is to affirm the need for voles. The only true freedom from the
ego consists in finding a replacement object, or ur-consciousnessness to
reality, to replace the voice of personality which we often mistake for the
world.

Our human problems on earth do not distill to simplifications like the
narratives offered by the press because they are popular: we the people are
exceptional, except when oppressed by kings, government, corporations or the
beautiful people. Our human problems begin and end in our inability to recognize
reality and enforce it upon ourselves; we instead opt for pleasant illusions,
and generate the negative consequences one might expect.

If we do not get rid of our fears, they rule us. If we have created a false
antidote to our fears, like a false sense of inherent meaning, we have doubly
enslaved ourselves to those fears: first, the fears persist because we have no
logical answer to them, and second, we are now indebted to the dogma that
supposedly dispels them. This is why human problems have remained relatively
unchanged for centuries.

As a philosophical groundwork, nihilism gives us a tool with which to approach
all parts of life and make sense of them. Unlike merely political or religious
solutions, it underlies all of our thinking, and by removing false hope, gives
us a hope in the work of our own two hands. Where others rage against the world,
we rage for it -- and in doing so, provide a saner future.
