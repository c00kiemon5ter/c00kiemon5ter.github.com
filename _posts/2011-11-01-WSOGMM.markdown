================
The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash (WSOGMM) is the sum total of all the
different ways that exists of looking at things, or more specifically, all the
different probabilities that exist through which you could look at things.

One could imagine the term as, the sum total of all the parallel universes, which
aren't parallel, and furthermore are not, strictly speaking, universes either.

This is easier to understand, if you try to realize that, everything you have
realized until up to this moment is not true.

The reason that universes are not universes is that any given universe is not a
thing as such, but rather just a way of looking at the WSOGMM. The reason they
are not parallel is the same reason the sea is not parallel. You can slice the
WSOGMM any way you like and you will generally come up with something that
someone will call home.

The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash, one could say, should be viewed as a plate
of pie, or as a large tank of water. You could slice it and divide it up any way
you'd like, and you'll almost always find a way of looking at things somewhere
in probability (eg. a parallel universe) that somebody will find familiar.
