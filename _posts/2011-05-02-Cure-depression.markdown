================
I was a bit down the previous couple of days.
I'm still not sure why, I just kinda felt alone.
That was until I got myself a fluffy chocolate cake this morning.

Here is a similar [story] I bumped onto tonight.

The Cure for Depression?
------------------------

Hello, there should be more blogs about dealing with depression when you're stupid and worthless, so here is a self help blog entry. 

Today's assignment is simple.
Just go out and get on the bus. 

It doesn't matter which bus. Whichever bus comes next. Get on, and just go.
You could ride that bus to the very end, thank the driver, and then walk into the woods and just die.
Just lay down right there and wait and wait until you were dead.
Who is going to miss you?

Really, think about it.
If you went out to the middle of nowhere and just sat down in a ditch and cried by yourself until you were dead,
who would be the first person to wonder where you'd gone?

Call them up! Maybe they want to get ice cream?

or even cupcakes, or maybe coookies! -- {{ page.date | date_to_string }}
