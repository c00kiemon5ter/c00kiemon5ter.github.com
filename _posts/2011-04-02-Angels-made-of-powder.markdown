Yeah, that's right, powder!

I'll be making posts like this whenever I come upon a really interesting band. 
So, the last couple of days I've been listening to those really nice bands
while baking cookies.

All Angels Gone
---------------
[All angels gone][angels] is a post-rock band from France consisting of 7 members.
They are closer to [A Silver Mt Zion][silver] than whatever I've heard before. 
It's beautiful, melodic, atmospheric, depressing. Just listen. 

Check them on [myspace][spaceangels] and [lastfm][lastangels]

Powder! Go away
---------------
Funny name :D This one sounds happier than the previous but remains melodic and magnificent.
I couldn't find much info on those guys that makes it even more interesting. I discovered 
their [myspace][spacepowder] profile. It seems to be a 4 member band. Some music clips are 
on [youtube][powdertube]. 

Ana Never
---------
[Ana never][ana] is a 4 member band from Serbia. It features dark long sounds and lengthy tracks
with little lyrics on the background (check *streetlights*). It almost feels like [GY!BE][]. 

Check them on [myspace][anaspace] and [lastfm][lastana]
