================
When out of ideas of what to code, or when getting familiar with a new
programming language, a really nice escape route is to get your hands on some
quizzes and projects, that will get you going.

Here are some really interesting ones:

* _[Project Euler][eu]_

  Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
  problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
  Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
  the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
  problems.

  The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide
  a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new
  concepts in a fun and recreational context.

* _[Code Golf][golf]_

  A free, community driven Q&A for programming puzzle enthusiasts and code
  golfers. It is a part of the [Stack Exchange network of Q&A websites][se]

* _[Virtual Source][vs]_

  Virtual source, is a series of programming contests. Participants register
  teams and winners win a prize.

If you have more in mind, let me know and I'll add them to the list.

A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth
knowing -- {{ page.date | date_to_string }}
